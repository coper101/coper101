Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Daryl / @coper101

I'm constantly learning new things. I mostly develop Android and iOS apps.

Aside from coding, designing user interfaces is one of my hobbies as well.
I'm currently using Figma as its free. 

Currently, I'm learning Jetpack compose which is a new way to code Android apps.
I've also built my first Swift UI too.

If you've reached reading this line, Thanks!
