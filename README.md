👋 Hello, I’m Daryl / @coper101

I'm constantly learning new things. I mostly develop Android and iOS apps 🍎🤖

Aside from coding, designing user interfaces is one of my hobbies as well.
I use Figma to create mobile wireframes as its free and it comes with a bunch of cool features. 

Currently, I'm learning Jetpack Compose which is a new way to code Android apps.
I've also built my first Swift UI too. I must say Declarative Programming in mobile development is 👌🏼

If you've reached reading this line, Thanks for your time! 🙏🏼
